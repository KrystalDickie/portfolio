I am an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. This is my online portfolio to showcase the work I've done while in the Interactive Media Design program, specifically photography and website/app re-design since that is what I tend to focus on.
I've created this website using HTML, CSS and bootstrap.
I started off with creating the base with HTML and bootstrap then added the CSS to customize the website further.
Since I am rather new to using bootstrap that was quite a challenge for me to know the correct class names so I used the bootstrap library to help me figure out certain elements and classes.

I also had struggles with optimizing the website for different device sizes to which I had to review the bootstrap library breakpoints and grid system.
I learned a lot more about bootstrap while building this website.

I referenced these libraries and templates to help build my online portfolio.
